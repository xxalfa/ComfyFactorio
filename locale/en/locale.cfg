map_info=	- - B I T E R    B A T T L E S - -\n\n	Your objective is to defend your team's rocket silo and defeat the other team.\n	Feed the opponent's biters with science packs to increase their strength.\n	High tier science juice will yield stronger results.\n\n	There is no major direct pvp combat.\n	The horizontal border river is landfill proof.\n	Construction robots can not build on the other teams's side.\n	The random map layout is mirrored to provide a fair competition.\n\n	West and East directions contain no biter nests,\n	leaving room for factory expansion and outpost building.\n	North and South directions are biter territory.\n\n	There is no biter evolution from pollution, or destruction.\n	ONLY feeding increases their power and will lead to your teams victory.\n\n	The gui yields two different main stats for each team's biters.\n\n	    - EVO -\n	    The evolution of the biters, which increases when they get fed.\n	    It can go above 100% which unlocks endgame modifiers,\n	    granting them increased damage and health.\n\n	    - THREAT -\n     Causes biters to attack and reduces when biters are slain.\n	    Feeding gives permanent "threat-income", as well as creating instant threat.\n	    A high threat value causes big attacks.\n	    Values of zero or below will cause no attacks.

map_info_text=This is a harsh world, the heat is unbearable and the sand is sharp like diamonds.\nMake sure to stay properly hydrated.\nDrink some water from a pond, or sip it out of a barrel to stay refreshed.\n\nWe shall not attempt to travel without a proper vehicle.\nMany building foundations are not possible to be set up outside of the oasis.\nRailways between them however should be possible.\n\nLuckily the ship's moisture meter module did survive the crash.\nIt may come in handy!
